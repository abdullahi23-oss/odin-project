    <p><strong><em>Beef Stroganoff</em></strong>, dish of French origin by way of tsarist Russia that combines thinly sliced 
        and lightly stewed beef and onions with sour cream and other ingredients.</p>

        <p><strong>Beef Stroganoff is,</strong> in essence, the classic French fricassée de boeuf with the addition 
            of equally classic Russian ingredients: onions and sour cream. There is disagreement over 
            which member of the noble Stroganov family was honoured with the name of the dish. 
            One theory holds that the general and diplomat Pavel Alexandrovich Stroganov, or Stroganoff, 
            while visiting France, was feted with a variation on the dish, which was made with a sauce of Dijon mustard instead of sour cream. 
            A second theory ventures that Charles Brière, a French chef living in Russia, 
            simply attached the name of the noble family, which owned much of Siberia while maintaining a palace in St. 
            Petersburg, to the dish that in 1891 earned him the grand prize at a culinary competition in what was then the Russian capital. 
            It is possible that Brière had worked for the Stroganov family earlier, but, to complicate matters, a cookbook published in St. 
            Petersburg in the 19th century contains a recipe called govjadina po-strogonovski s gorchitseju, or beef Stroganoff with mustard, 
            which lends support to the first theory while diminishing the claim that Brière was its originator.</p>

            <h3>The steps or Direction</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rapid boil.
                     Cook egg noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 7 to 9 minutes.
                      Drain.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, cook ground beef in a large skillet over medium-high heat, 
                    stirring occasionally, until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; 
                    drain and discard grease. Stir in cream cheese, mushrooms with liquid, 
                    and gravy mix; cook and stir over medium heat until cream cheese melts, 
                    2 to 3 minutes. Add condensed soup, sour cream, and milk; cook, 
                    stirring occasionally, until smooth and creamy, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Drain egg noodles; stir into the beef mixture. Cook until heated through,
                         2 to 3 minutes.</li>
