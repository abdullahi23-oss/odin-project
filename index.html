            <h2>Best Chicken for Chicken Stir Fry</h2>
            <p>
                Chicken breasts and chicken thighs both work well for stir fries.
                Just make sure the pieces are relatively small and thin. 
                Plus, they should be about the same size so the chicken cooks evenly.
